# Ticketee
It's a project-ticket tracking system built in Rails. It can serve as a playground at which you can experiment with individual features you are interested in such as Single-Sign-On using third party account.

The project stemmed from the book [Rails 4 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action). It's in the state where the book ends.
